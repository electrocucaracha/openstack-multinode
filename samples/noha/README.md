# OpenStack No High Availability Configuration

This configuration was designed to create a minimal OpenStack cluster using
[Raspberry Pi 4 Model B][1] without High Availability. The [provisioning
process](../../install.sh) is executed on the Controller node and creates a
local registry on it using the [registry script](../../registry.sh) and deploys
OpenStack services using the [undercloud script](../../undercloud.sh).

The following diagram shows the distribution of OpenStack Kolla containers
created by this configuration.

## Hardware Details

* Broadcom BCM2711, Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz
* 4GB or 8GB LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM

## Vagrant execution

Once Vagrant is installed, it's possible to deploy an OpenStack cluster on
Virtual Machines.

```bash
VAGRANT_EXPERIMENTAL=disks vagrant up
vagrant up controller
```

### Environment variables

This table displays the environment variables used to configure some aspects of
the cluster, hardware resources and workflow.

| Name                     | Default | Description                                                                                                   |
|:-------------------------|:--------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OS_NUM_COMPUTE_NODES     | 2       | Specifies the number of OpenStack compute nodes                                                               |
| OS_ENABLE_LOCAL_REGISTRY | true    | Determines if a local registry will be deployed on the Controller node. This includes the Kolla build process |
| CPUS                     | 4       | Number of vCPUS assigned to the Virtual Machine                                                               |
| MEMORY                   | 8 GB    | Memory assigned to the Virtual Machine (Compute nodes use 4 GB )                                              |
